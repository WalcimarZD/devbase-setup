## 2026-01-06 - Unified Diagnostic Feedback
**Learning:** Users often miss manual troubleshooting steps when they are mixed with auto-fixable issues or hidden behind a "success" message for auto-fixes. Separating "Manual Attention Required" from "Auto-Fixable" issues in a unified table significantly improves clarity and ensures users don't skip critical manual steps.
**Action:** When designing diagnostic or audit tools, always present a complete "Treatment Plan" that clearly distinguishes between what the tool can do (Auto) and what the user must do (Manual), using distinct visual cues (Green vs Yellow).
