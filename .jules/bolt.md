## 2024-05-22 - Incremental Indexing Pattern
**Learning:** Checking file modification times against a database index before processing avoids expensive I/O and parsing (Frontmatter/Markdown) for unchanged files. This turns O(N) operations into O(N_changed) for subsequent runs.
**Action:** Apply this "stat-first" pattern to any file synchronization or indexing task.
